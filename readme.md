# Documenting the [Carousel Testimonial Section]:
## 1- Bootstrap Carousel: 
1) It's not card-friendly.
2) Bootstrap Carousel can be used to fulfill the task requirement, but it necessitates  the use of JS.
## 2- Swiper JS
1) A Javascript built-in library.
2) Best-in-slot option for the Task requirement but JS is not currently required.
3) Can be done with minimal JS code and will do the work perfectly, but as mentioned above, JS is not required just yet.
## 3- CSS Scroll-Snap Property:
1) A css property that makes the cards slide on touch or by clicking on the dots underneath the cards (pagination).
2)  On smaller screens (<=768px): each dot represents an ID for each card, while on larger screens the dots behave differently.
3)  The left dot shows the cards(1-2-3), the middle dot shows the cards(2-3-4) while the right dot shows the cards(3-4-5) all with sliding effect.
## 4- Slick Carousel ??
